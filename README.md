# Morse
Electric telegraph is operated on a 2-wire line with a key that, when pressed, connects the wires together, which can be detected on a remote station. The Morse code encodes every character being transmitted as a sequence of "dots" (short presses on the key) and "dashes" (long presses on the key).

When transmitting the Morse code, the international standard specifies that:

"Dot" – is 1 time unit long.
"Dash" – is 3 time units long.
Pause between dots and dashes in a character – is 1 time unit long.
Pause between characters inside a word – is 3 time units long.
Pause between words – is 7 time units long.
However, the standard does not specify how long that "time unit" is. And in fact different operators would transmit at different speed. An amateur person may need a few seconds to transmit a single character, a skilled professional can transmit 60 words per minute, and robotic transmitters may go way faster.

For example, the message HEY JUDE, that is .... . -.--   .--- ..- -.. . may be received as follows:

1100110011001100000011000000111111001100111111001111110000000000000011001111110011111100111111000000110011001111110000001111110011001100000011
